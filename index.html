    <div><b>Hello! My name is Griselda Muci. I'm 23 years old. I am a graduate student in
        mathematics and informatics. I have always had a passion for mathematics. Outside of school, I 
        did sudokus, measured my entire house, made graphs, and even created my own problems to
        explore mathematics. I would do all of my work, including tests, without a calculator just to
        challenge myself and do more math. As the concepts increased in difficulty, the subject became
        even more fun for me. The dedication and creativity required in advanced
        mathematics have only empowered my enthusiasm for mathematics. My goal is to share
        my passion and dedication in math to other people. During my
        years of study Iâ€™ve learned the basics of programming.</b></div>
